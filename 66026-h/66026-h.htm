  <h2 class='c005'>MONEY! IS IT A PRINCIPLE OR A PROPERTY?</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>To the careful student of history, there is a very great deal more
to be considered than the mere political facts that stand as landmarks
along the path of progress which the nations have traversed
since the plains of Iran poured forth their hosts westward. These facts
are the mere externals that adorn the pages of historic lore, and
embellish the memories of the great men who have lived in and moved
the world at various times in various nations, or which clothe the
lives of tyrants and usurpers with their just reward.</p>

<p class='c007'>The superficial student of history cares only for the <i>results</i> of the
evolution of nations—for the <i>fact</i> that Sesostris was the greatest of
Egyptian kings; or that Semiramis rose by her military sagacity from
the rank of a mean official’s wife to be, first, the Queen of Ninas,
and afterward, to be the Assyrian Queen, who should march an army of
three millions men across the Indus to conquer the Indian King.
Running down the course of events, he traces the rise and fall of
nations—after Assyria then Egypt, next Persia, Greece, Rome and then
the Dark Ages, out of whose womb was evolved modern Europe;
and, lastly, the birth, development, struggle and recovery of the most
remarkable nation which has yet arisen in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Behind these facts, which are but results, lie the real motor powers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>of history; and they are deeper, broader and more important than is that
which <i>they</i> evolve. There is an external and an internal phase to
everything existent in the world. Up to <i>this</i> generation the external
has apparently borne the more prominent part in determining what
should be next. But <i>now</i> the analytic age has begun, wherein facts do
not suffice; wherein new systems, new theories, new philosophies and
even new religions are constructed, not by an examination of the <i>errors</i>
of what has been, but by the <i>discovery</i> and <i>application</i> of the principles,
the powers, which underlie those errors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Heretofore there has been no inquiry made by the rulers of the
people into the general principles of government. It was sufficient that
there was a government maintained, the governors caring for little but
the power to compel the people to do their bidding. But it is beginning
to dawn upon the minds of those who have something more than
a selfish interest in humanity that there <i>is a science</i> of government;
aye, even that there is a science of society: and such minds are endeavoring
by the deepest researches to discover the principles of these
sciences.</p>

<p class='c007'>In our government, the principle of individual rights is theoretically
held, though in its application government still interferes with those
rights. The legitimate functions of a government, based upon the rights
of every individual over whom its power is exercised, are limited to the
<i>duties</i> that will best <i>subserve</i> and <i>protect</i> the interests of individuals.
The proper understanding and practice of these functions is the most
important thing for a people to arrive at, but, having arrived at this as
the basis of all the relations of the people, the scientific construction of
the various departments of the complete superstructure which is to
cover all the public interests of all the people, as well as to maintain
their private interests intact, can be begun.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the general principles of government are properly formulated
in Constitutions and vitality given them by laws, a correct, a scientific
financial system stands <i>next</i> in importance. If a country have a true
system of <i>government</i>, and do not have a true system of <i>finance</i>, it can
never attain to any <i>permanent</i> prosperity. Literally speaking, finance
is a <i>part</i> of government; since, in organizing it, means for its support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>are among the first considerations. Hence it is plain, if there are principles
of government, so must there also be principles of finance.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has never been pretended, so far as I know, even by the profoundest
political economists, who are sticklers for the gold standard,
that any financial systems the world has ever known were developed by
the scientific application of self-evident truths, which is the nature of
principles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The various systems of which use has been made were simply <i>experimental</i>,
devised for <i>politic</i> reasons, as the <i>best</i> methods to meet the
exigencies of the times in which they were required. Instance the
Greenback, the necessity for which was such as to shake the nation to
its very centre, and to fill the minds of all patriots with a dread foreboding.</p>

<p class='c007'>If there have been no scientific money systems in vogue, and it now
comes out that the world has arrived at that degree of advancement
wherein <i>policy</i> should give way to <i>principles</i>, even in finance, there can
be nothing gained by going back to review the errors, failures and
fallacies of the past. Nothing valuable can be gained by wading
through the almost innumerable statistics which have accumulated to
a sufficiently great extent to bewilder the most comprehensive intellects.
Having for ten years been deeply engaged in studying the principles
of government, I learned that no system of government could be
perfect unless its financial department was perfected; therefore I have
frequently endeavored to solve the financial problems which statistics
propose, but <i>invariably</i> failed to learn anything that even promised to
look well as a basis for a new and improved system, to say nothing of
its promises in operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conclusion was inevitable, that there have been <i>no</i> acknowledged
or even known, fundamental principles of finance operating in <i>any</i>
of the many systems of the many nations, and that the so-called money
of the world <i>is not now, nor ever was</i>, money, in the scientific sense of
that term.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the statistics, failures and errors of the past, with which the
history of money abounds, being of no value, must be utterly ignored
in any inquiry which proposes to predicate a natural and scientific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>money, as distinguished from arbitrary inventions, devised to meet the
various exigencies of nations in their growth, prime and decay. And
<i>any</i> person who proposes to teach finance, or a new system, by arraying
before you the evidences of the past, contained in figures amounting
to billions of dollars, simply proposes to try <i>another experiment</i>, to <i>culminate</i>
in another failure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore I shall present no principals, per cents. and compounded
amounts, except, perhaps, as examples to illustrate the mathematical
impossibilities of the fallacious theories by which financiers have attempted
to dazzle the world, but who have only succeeded in accumulating
in the hands of a very select few that which by an exact justice
should belong to, and be distributed among, the people generally.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to intelligently discuss and arrive at legitimate conclusions
regarding the question of money, it should be <i>first</i> determined just what
is to be involved in the discussion; for around this, as around all other
general things, there has been such a mass of rubbish and extraneous
matter aggregated that the main question is always in danger of being
lost sight of, unless this be first removed and the real issue left clearly
exposed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the confusion which follows the attempts to solve the money
question arises out of the fact that the <i>same</i> words in the mouths of
<i>different</i> people do not mean the <i>same</i> things, or that <i>different</i> words are
used by <i>different</i> people to mean the <i>same</i> thing. If there are two words
in common use to represent similar objects, but which, upon close analysis,
<i>do not</i> represent precisely the same thing, it is better that <i>one</i> of
them be discarded. It is necessary, therefore, to settle, prior to the
beginning of this argument, <i>precisely</i> what the several terms <i>do</i> mean
which are prominently in use in connection with the money question.
It is, perhaps, near the truth to say that this settlement is the argument.
Very few persons have any well-defined comprehension of what is the
<i>real</i> significance of the terms <i>gold</i>, <i>money</i>, <i>currency</i>, <i>intrinsic value</i> and
<i>wealth</i>. If these words are analyzed, what do they scientifically represent?</p>

<p class='c007'>Gold is a product of the earth only to be originally obtained by labor
and expense, and both practically and scientifically bears like relations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span><i>to</i> labor that all other things do which are produced <i>by</i> labor; and none
other. But there has been an importance attached to gold which has
not been accorded to <i>any other</i> product of labor. It has been coined
and called money, because it was coined, and by custom and common
acceptance made an <i>arbitrary</i> standard of value, which <i>none</i> of its qualities
warrant when subjected to analysis, as will be shortly shown.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gold bears the same relation to <i>real</i> money that a religious theory
bears to <i>real</i> religion, which theory, when comprehended by the intellect
of the people, loses its value as a substitute for real religion; but
which, until comprehension comes, it is better to have than to have none
at all. So also with gold. It has in <i>theory</i> been considered as <i>money</i>;
but when a <i>true</i> money comes to be comprehended, it will lose its value
as a substitute therefor, and sink to its proper sphere among the other
products of labor.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is altogether probable that gold was the very best substitute
for money during that part of the world’s evolution wherein people
were guided and controlled by policy and before principles were recognized
as that which should govern, let their action lead where it might.
As the world is now beginning to act from <i>principle</i>, for the sake of the
<i>truth</i>, so also must they now begin to formulate the principle of
money for the sake of the principle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wealth is whatever is produced by labor which adds to the <i>comforts</i>,
the <i>happiness</i> or the <i>life</i> of man; and everything that does this,
either directly or indirectly, has intrinsic value—that is, has the capacity
to bless mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wealth may, and should, be divided into two kinds, namely, <i>permanent</i>
wealth and <i>transitory</i> wealth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Permanent wealth consists of all those products of labor which are
not themselves <i>transferable</i> into life, comfort or happiness, but which
may at all times be <i>exchanged</i> for that which is thus transferable into
that which can be used to continue life. Gold, silver and precious
stones are among the best illustrations there are of permanent
wealth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Transitory wealth consists of all those products of labor of which
direct use is made to maintain life or to add to its comforts and happiness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>and which, <i>by</i> such process, are absorbed <i>into</i> and become <i>a part of</i>
the life of humanity. Transitory wealth, it will be seen, is much the
more important of the two, since, if people only possessed permanent
wealth, their life could not be continued an hour by it, unless there
were a possibility of exchanging it for the necessities of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would seem that <i>all</i> kinds of wealth are intrinsically valuable,
since its various kinds may be either <i>directly</i> used to maintain life or
may be <i>exchanged</i> for those which will maintain life. Wealth and
intrinsic value, then, mean the same thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>But what does the term <i>money</i> mean: or has it no necessary significance
in the inquiry?</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a time when there was no such <i>thing</i> or <i>word</i> as money;
but at that time there was life to continue, for which wealth was necessary.
It seems that <i>wealth</i> had existence before <i>money</i> was thought
of. Wealth is substance, of which money is the principle or representative,
but which, in itself, has no intrinsic value.</p>

<p class='c007'>Money is an invention made to <i>represent</i> wealth, or value, in order
that its various kinds may be exchanged with facility, or that they may
be exchanged without the absolute and direct and immediate receipt
and delivery of one product of labor for another product of labor. All
the products of labor may be exchanged <i>directly</i>, and without the use of
any representative or go-between, which for the time being stands representative
of the one or the other, but <i>not so well</i> at all times and
under all circumstances. Money is <i>anything</i> which stands representative
of any product of labor; that is, that can be made use of to facilitate
the exchange of any of the results of labor, which are wealth. A
representative of anything cannot be the thing itself, therefore, if money
is a representative of wealth it is not itself wealth. Were A, B and
C to at all times exchange their products between themselves by
<i>direct transfer</i>, they would have <i>no use</i> for money; they would exchange—deliver
and receive—<i>actual</i> values. But when A desires from B some
of his products, himself not having on hand any of his products which
B desires, he receives from B his value and gives him his representative
of value—his note—promising that at a future time he will deliver B the
<i>actual</i> value which he desires.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span><i>Currency</i> is only a <i>form</i> of money, the same as <i>gold</i> is only a
form of wealth; and in the same manner that gold is wealth, is currency
money. Money being the principle of representation in exchange,
everything of which use is made to facilitate exchange in the form of
representative value is money. Anything which can be transferred
from one party to another, anything that is negotiable which is not actual
value of itself, is money. This includes not only all currency,
bank notes, but also bills of exchange, the ledger and bonds. These
are <i>all</i> representatives of wealth, <i>all</i> demands for payment at a future
time of a certain specified sum, and consequently are money. It is
quite evident that, with the terms <i>wealth</i> and <i>money</i>, we have all the
necessary distinctions which should enter into the abstract question of
finance. All other terms are but names for separate kinds or forms of
these terms, to be made use of when they respectively arise in making
exchanges.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, every one must at once concede that that which best represents
all of the products of labor will also best <i>exchange</i> them, and is therefore
the <i>best</i> money. It is <i>equally clear</i> that gold in <i>no way</i> represents
<i>any</i> labor but that which produces it. If gold were a true representative
of the results of <i>all</i> other labor, except that which produces it,
would it not also be apparent that <i>such</i> labor must be <i>equal</i> to <i>all</i> other
labor. Were gold a thousand times more valuable than it is held to be,
it would not <i>even then</i> be able to represent all other values. Therefore,
gold is a <i>false</i> standard of value, a <i>false</i> representative of wealth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many people think and speak as if gold would be of no use to
this country if it were to come into disuse as <i>money</i>; that we should entirely
lose it as <i>wealth</i>; the very reverse is really true, since we
should have just the same quantity of gold that we <i>now</i> have, to be
used for the <i>same</i> purposes for which it is now required, to wit: to export
to other countries in exchange for imports.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suppose our imports to amount to a thousand millions dollars
per annum, and that we export cotton, corn and pork to
that amount, what use would we have for gold except to loan other
countries, and could we not <i>loan</i> it as <i>gold</i>, taking their representatives
of value for it equally as well as though it were coined into money,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>having the seal and stamp of the government? It is well known that
we do not export gold to Europe as so many American dollars, but
as so much gold, by weight of a certain degree of fineness, the stamp
of the government attesting to that degree.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again: Suppose that we had no cotton, corn or pork to give in exchange
for our imports, and that we produced a thousand millions dollars’
worth of gold per annum, should we not be <i>equally</i> well conditioned
to trade with Europe?</p>

<p class='c007'>It is seen that the real character and qualities of gold are the same
as are those of any other product of labor, which we can exchange
direct, for other products of labor which we want more than we do
the gold. If at any time the balance of trade is <i>against</i> us, and we have
<i>no</i> cotton, corn, pork, gold or <i>anything else</i> to make it good, we must
then make it good by our representatives of value—our bonds—to be
converted when we shall have these products. This process has been
actually going on ever since we began to export bonds, either national,
state, county, city, railroad or bonds of other incorporated companies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, is it not <i>perfectly</i> evident that we have not only produced by
labor what we have exported, which we have been pleased to denominate
merchandise, but also that we have produced all the gold that
has been exported; and in this connection is it not just as much an
article of merchandise as is either cotton or corn? Gold cannot at <i>one</i> and
the <i>same</i> time be both <i>money</i> and <i>merchandise</i>. If <i>gold</i> is money, so
also is <i>wheat</i>, <i>cotton</i> and <i>corn</i> money, since they perform the same <i>services</i>
and possess the same <i>qualities</i> as merchandise that gold does.</p>

<p class='c007'>To be perfectly clear in our conclusions, money must be resolved into
its <i>uses</i> and entirely divested of all its <i>fictitious</i> and <i>irrelevant</i> relations.
The fact that money is that thing which is made use of to exchange
real values must be the initial starting-point, of which sight must
never be lost until it is <i>definitely</i> settled what will <i>best</i> perform this service.
Anything which can be made use of for <i>any other purpose whatever</i>,
is <i>not</i> the <i>best</i> thing to be made use of as money; because the demand
for such a thing for such other purposes destroys its positive value
as money by causing fluctuations in its exchanging power.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a grave financial error for this country to endeavor to return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>to gold as money. All the practices under the gold standard have been
positive and ample refutations of the arbitrary value accorded to gold.
A <i>dollar</i> in gold can only exchange a <i>dollar</i> in value in any other substance;
and the practice of issuing a greater amount of bank notes than
the bank has gold dollars to redeem them by, is a <i>legalized</i> system to <i>rob</i>
the people; since it is <i>evident</i> that a bank having three hundred thousand
dollars in notes in circulation, and only one hundred thousand dollars
in gold in its vaults, can redeem but <i>one-third</i> of its circulation if it be
all presented at once for redemption. All the other securities of a bank,
such as its discounts, personal property and real estate, may become of
no value, or may be placed out of reach of the holders of its circulation,
so that the only <i>real</i> security for its circulation is what it may have
in gold in its vaults. Beside, what right has a bank to receive legal
interest on three times the amount of its real security? Is not this a
most <i>transparent</i> method of <i>swindling</i> the people? Hence I assert that
the use of gold as money <i>always</i> results disastrously to the producers
of wealth, and <i>always</i> beneficially to those who are permitted to absorb
all their productions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another unanswerable reason why gold cannot answer the requirements
of money is found in the <i>degrees of value</i> which belong to
different products of labor, and which are <i>universally</i> determined by
the sacrifice required to produce them. That is to say, all other things
being equal, the <i>relative</i> value of products is determined by the <i>time</i>
and <i>labor</i> required to produce them. The increase in the value of manufactured
material is in <i>exact</i> proportion to the <i>time</i> required and
<i>wealth</i> consumed in their manufacture. The value of gold is determined
in <i>precisely</i> the same manner; and it is simply foolishness to assert
that the value of gold never changes, or that it has the same purchasing
power at all times.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suppose there should be immense fields of gold suddenly developed
all over the country, so that it would become as common and plentiful
as iron or coal, would it not decrease in value in comparison with
other products? That is to say, would an ounce of gold then possess as
great a proportionate value to other products as it now does? No one
will pretend it. Then gold is just as much the subject of fluctuation as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>is any other product of labor, and for <i>just the same</i> reasons—demand and
supply—which are the great arbitrators of values in all parts of the
world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Everybody knows that for a certain quantity of gold a certain quantity
of cotton may be obtained, and for a certain quantity of corn, a horse.
The fact that the horse is obtainable by the corn does not convert the corn
into money, neither does gold any more than the corn become money because
the cotton is obtained thereby. The gold for the time is equal in
value to the cotton, and so is the corn to the horse. Now, what is required
of money is this: Suppose the gold, cotton, corn and the horse to be of
equal value, a person possessing an amount of money representing the
value of either of the four can, at his discretion, purchase whichever he
may choose; since the money would equally represent the gold, cotton,
corn and the horse. Anything that may be used for money that will not
do the same thing for any variety of the products of labor, values being
equal, is not money in any sense of that term.</p>

<p class='c007'>Incidentally in this connection, because it has an indirect bearing
upon the question under consideration, I wish to call attention to a
mistake that has been productive of more financial ills and consequent
injustice to a large proportion of the people, who are the wealth producers,
than any other single cause, and that is the fundamental error of
making land, wealth, which it is no more entitled to be, scientifically,
than gold is to be called money. Wealth is that which is produced.
Land exists. All improvements made upon land are wealth; <i>but the
land proper, never</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this almost fatal mistake—almost fatal to the humanitarian interests
of the so-called common people—which is fundamental in its nature,
is found the <i>basis</i> upon which rest the vast disparities in the distributions
of wealth, and which gives to certain favored individuals the
means of realizing vast fortunes without ever resorting to the production
of wealth, or of even accumulating it by trafficking in the different
kinds of wealth.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are numerous examples of this manner of becoming possessed
of riches. People acquire title to lands which, by favorable
location, come into great demand and consequently rise in value from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span><i>one dollar per acre to hundreds of thousands of dollars per acre</i>. By what
principle of <i>equity</i> and <i>right</i> should <i>any</i> person be entitled to such vast
increases in capital invested in land, when it is entirely attributable to
the movements of the community which produce it, and in no single
particular to the individual? To be so entitled is for the individual to
possess advantages over others to which no just communal government
should for a moment consent—is to have the right to appropriate to self
the results of labor which belong in common to all the people. Such
results are against <i>all</i> principles of equity and justice, and is one of
the <i>greatest</i>, if not <i>the</i> greatest error of the present, regarding the equities
of property, and is the foundation and prophecy of all other kinds of
monopoly.</p>

<p class='c007'>It occurs to me that an objection may be raised to my argument
classing gold as wealth, and defining wealth to be that which can be
made use of to minister to life, comfort and happiness; or perhaps to
the distinction of permanent and transitory wealth. Gold, as permanent
wealth, can only minister to man through its exchange for other
valuables of which direct use can be made. It may be said that in <i>that</i>
sense gold can legitimately be money.</p>

<p class='c007'>But if there are objectors to this argument, I beg to call their attention
to the conclusive fact that gold <i>can never</i> be representative of all
other kinds of wealth. It is just as impossible that it should be, as it is
that a bridge <i>one</i> hundred feet in length should span a river <i>five</i> hundred
feet in width. It must further be remembered that the uses for
which money is required demand an invention which can be made use
of for <i>no other</i> purpose whatever, and that money is the name of an invention
<i>demanded</i> and made for the purpose of <i>facilitating</i> exchanges—for
making them easy, <i>convenient</i> and <i>adaptable</i> to <i>all</i> conditions of <i>all</i>
persons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every attempt ever made to compel gold to answer the demands
of money has been a disastrous failure. So long as a country enjoys
continuous prosperity under a gold standard of value, it is all well
enough. The people make use of an expanded volume of currency in
the full faith that prosperity will continue and everything be smooth
and right.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>But anon a <i>change</i> comes, the nation is precipitated into conditions
which require <i>more</i> than its accumulations of gold to meet. <i>That</i> being
exhausted, it is <i>inevitable</i> that representation be resorted to. The
wealth in the form of gold not being adequate, and other wealth not
having been used or accepted as money, paper representatives of it are
the <i>only</i> resort. So it appears that when an <i>emergency</i> arises the people
are <i>involuntarily</i> pressed to the use of the principle of representation,
which is the <i>only</i> scientific thing that can be called money. So that
while a paper representative of wealth is, <i>with everything else</i>, a product
of labor, it is more than that; it is the embodiment and application of
a principle, which other products of labor are not; and all principles
are fundamental; are the basis of all permanent and all purely scientific
things and truths, while wealth is the realized product of the outworking
of principles, directed and appropriated by man for his use
and convenience.</p>

<p class='c007'>The direct inquiry can now be made as to <i>what</i> will <i>best perform</i>
what the people require of money; and money is that which can be
used to <i>represent</i> real values without an absolute <i>transfer</i> of such values.
The basis of all value of this country is our <i>present</i> accumulated <i>real</i>
wealth and our <i>capacity</i> to increase it, and this accumulation and the
prospective increase may be <i>wholly</i> represented by money and the nation
never become bankrupt.</p>

<p class='c007'>A person may possess wealth to the amount of ten thousand dollars
upon which he may issue his representatives of value or promises to pay
that value. These representatives of value would circulate among
those who believe in the capacity and intention of the utterer to give
<i>up</i> to them, <i>when</i> demanded, that which they represent. Everybody by
his individual right has the authority to issue such representatives of
value, and no government has any right to prohibit their circulation;
because the people, as individuals, have the right to take or refuse
them. The issue of bank notes is upon the same principle, and so
long as the government does not in substance <i>indorse</i> these issues, the
people have the <i>perfect</i> right to deal in them—to receive and deliver
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there is an insuperable objection—one which cannot be overcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>by any governmental requirements—to these representatives being
called the real money of the people, since circumstances over which
<i>neither</i> their utterers nor receivers can have <i>any</i> control may render them
valueless—may make it impossible for those who uttered them to redeem
them—and their holders find themselves with <i>bits of paper</i> representing
<i>nothing</i>; but for which they parted with real value.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far as this condition is confined to individuals who had no
other reason for receiving them, and no other assurance of their real
value than the supposed <i>capacity</i> and <i>intention</i> of the uttering person or
persons, it is <i>strictly</i> a legitimate condition; and one with which the
sufferers can find <i>no</i> fault; since of their own free will and choice they
received the utterers assurances that his representatives were of real
value. An individual upon his personal judgment, without undue persuasion,
accepts another’s representative; if it prove <i>bad</i> he has <i>himself
only</i> to blame for the loss, as coming from an error of judgment;
and <i>no power</i> or <i>authority</i> has any right to step in to compel the making
of amends for this error. <i>This</i> is the simple doctrine of the <i>rights</i> of <i>individuals</i>,
with which <i>no third party</i> has any right to interfere after the
occurrence of the fact. But when banks are organized under certain
formula of law, framed by the people or their representatives through
government, the people receive and pay out their issues—representatives
of their value—<i>not</i> because they have special confidence in the capacity
and intention of the individuals who compose the management, <i>but</i> because
they <i>suppose</i> the management has conformed to <i>those certain forms
of law</i> which are <i>intended</i> to render them safe. In this way the government,
at least indirectly, gives <i>credit</i> to the bank, and <i>currency</i> to its
issues, and the people accept them <i>simply</i> because the government has
done so.</p>

<p class='c007'>But if these banks are mismanaged either ignorantly or intentionally,
or managed by designing men, as often they are, who make use
of the governmental sanction to swindle the people, as many times they
have, <i>where</i> can the people look for redress; <i>where should</i> they look for
redress? The government is justly responsible to the people for all
such issues, since it did not require real security from the banks, and
government should make reparation therefor.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>This is precisely our objection to <i>any</i> and <i>all</i> forms of bank issues.
There can be <i>no</i> arrangement made so <i>perfect</i> in security to her people
as to <i>guarantee</i> them <i>absolutely</i> against all hazard, that will permit the
banks to make the profits which they seem to think they are entitled to
make from the people. In <i>absolute</i> security there can be <i>no</i> profit.
Bank profits demand the circulation of more notes than they have <i>real</i>
value to represent. Profits come only from speculating either upon the
<i>confidence</i> or the <i>money</i> of the people, and government has <i>no</i> right to
<i>protect</i> such <i>illegitimate</i> and <i>unjust</i> practices.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our present system of banking is a <i>swindle</i> upon the people, which
it is simply surprising that they endure as they have and do. For the
banks to be permitted to filch from the people twenty-four million dollars
per annum is an <i>outrageous villainy</i> which, if comprehended by the
people in its <i>true light</i>, could not exist <i>another year</i>. ’Tis true these
banks complied with the law passed in a time of dire necessity, and that
through them the government acquired the means to conduct the war.
But did not the people themselves do even <i>more</i> than furnish money,
which was promised to be returned; did they not freely give their <i>lives</i>,
which can never be returned, and which the government never thought
of promising to either return or guarantee, and that, too, for the pitiful
sum of thirteen dollars per month? What comparison is there between
the sacrifices made by the two classes of people, the capitalists who have
absorbed the wealth of the country and the laborers who still continue
to give life, property and vitality <i>to</i> the country. There is absolutely
<i>no</i> chance for a comparison; the distinction is <i>too</i> great.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems to me that if either class is entitled to superior consideration—to
receive millions of the people’s money—it is the common people
who so freely offered their <i>lives</i> to save their country, instead of
those who simply <i>loaned</i> their money at enormous rates of interest,
with the certain knowledge that it would be repaid. The present
claims are too preposterous, and deceptive, and too unjust to be long
continued.</p>

<p class='c007'>All bank notes in their ultimate effects are frauds upon the people,
and their continuation as a circulating medium is only possible because
that part of the people who suffer from them have not yet risen into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>proper understanding of the question. The time is, however, near at
hand when those who have reveled in the result, of the wear and tear
of the muscle, and the sweat of the brow, of the common laborer, will
be compelled to produce honestly and equitably everything they would
enjoy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The substitute for all kinds of bank notes as the money for the
people should be a <i>purely people’s money</i>—a <i>national currency</i> whose
basis of value would be the accumulated wealth of the country, and
also its capacity for regularly increasing such wealth. Is there any reliance
to be placed in a currency issued by an individual or a number
of individuals through an incorporated bank, based upon his or their
wealth, which is at all times liable to pass into the hands of other individuals?
Yes, there is a presumptive reliance—an indefinite security—but
the security is not perfect. In comparison with this security place
that of a currency issued by the government, based upon the <i>entire</i>
wealth of the <i>whole</i> country, which, no matter how much it might be
changed about among the different persons comprising the nation by various
contingencies, could never depart from the country; which fact
would render it safe under any and all contingencies that could possibly
arise, excepting alone the entire destruction of the country and its government
by a foreign power; which contingency is not sufficiently imminent
to cause any present alarm.</p>

<p class='c007'>A national currency <i>thus</i> based would have not only <i>all the gold</i> of
the country as a basis, but also <i>all other kinds of wealth</i>. Is it not perfectly
plain that such a money would be just so much better than
common bank notes, with a one-third gold basis, as the total amount of
the wealth of the country is greater than such amount of gold? It
would be in the most complete sense the people’s money. It would be
a system of mutual banking wherein every individual of the country
would have an interest, instead of there being a vast number of
mutual banking institutions, such as has been proposed by a person of
profound financial ideas.</p>

<p class='c007'>As before stated, my objection to all systems of individual banking
is that the <i>basis</i> of their issues is at all times <i>liable</i> to pass from the
possession of such individuals; whereas, in a national currency—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span><i>money</i> of the people, <i>themselves</i> in the aggregate the basis and security—there
could be <i>no such</i> liability; since, if <i>parts</i> of the security pass from
original to secondary hands, it is <i>still</i> the basis of the currency, and
could never be transferred beyond the jurisdiction of security by the
operations of designing or incapable persons. By no possibility could
there ever a loss occur to the holder of such a currency, except it be
destroyed in his hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Undoubtedly the <i>greenback</i> was the <i>nearest</i> approach to a <i>real</i> money
that any people of the earth ever made. We have only to observe how
<i>admirably</i> it has answered nearly all the purposes for which people require
money, to be convinced that it has the very best—the most secure—basis
that it is possible for a money to have. It stands representative
of the capacity and willingness of the government—the representative
of all the people—to pay.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it is one of the most <i>difficult</i> of things for the people to divorce
their minds from the idea that gold is the only possible, real money.
Yet the <i>facts</i> attaching to the greenback stand out in bold and indisputable
relief, perfectly and entirely dispelling all basis for the idea.
Because the greenback was the <i>first</i> step toward a real money that the
country ever took, which left gold entirely out of the question, the impression
still remains with the people that a <i>return</i> must be made to a
gold basis; never stopping to observe how vastly superior the wealth
basis is to what the gold basis would be.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bank note currency, or a currency issued by an individual or by a
class of individuals, always carries along with itself the <i>idea</i> and <i>need</i> of
redeemability. If, however, there is any thought among the people
that the utterers cannot meet their <i>promises</i> of redemption, at that <i>very</i>
time when, of <i>all</i> others, <i>confidence</i> is necessary to avoid <i>ruin</i>, they rush
to prove the suspected incapacity; and generally they do prove it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The idea of, and necessity for, redeemability, is that which <i>most</i> requires
to be <i>divorced</i> from money. Money—real money—should never
require to be redeemed. It should always be just as valuable to retain
possession of as anything could be into which it may be converted.
Anything that requires to be redeemed in order to make it <i>permanently</i>
valuable or a representative of value is utterly unworthy the name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>money, because it does not truly represent <i>real</i> wealth. It is that currency
of which there is doubt about the real wealth it pretends to represent
which requires to be made redeemable before it will circulate;
and <i>this</i> fact proves <i>most</i> conclusively that it is <i>not</i> money in any true
sense of that term: that is to say, it is not that which requires to be
converted into substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is readily perceivable that a national currency having continually
all the nation’s wealth, accumulated and prospective, as its basis, never
needs to be redeemed. This <i>single</i> consideration is of quite sufficient
importance to <i>alone</i> warrant its immediate adoption and use upon the
standard of wealth. The gold standard is the flimsiest deception of
which it is possible to imagine. The people’s talk of approaching a gold
standard as the ultimate of appreciation is the <i>merest <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</span></i>. Gold
is now selling at say 113. Suppose that during the next year its price
should gradually decline to par, or, in the phraseology of the goldites,
their country’s general credit should appreciate to par, would the process
of appreciation <i>necessarily</i> stop just at <i>that</i> point? Why should it not
just as reasonably <i>continue</i> to appreciate, so that in another year
gold would be below the par of the country’s credit? This simple
analysis proves beyond <i>all</i> cavil the arbitrariness of the gold standard
of value.</p>

<p class='c007'>The credit of a country increases or diminishes without <i>any</i> regard
whatever to its gold producing or paying capacity. It is governed
by its capacity for the <i>general</i> production of <i>all</i> kinds of wealth over
and above its average consumption. It is just the same with a country
as it is with an individual; the individual, to become wealthy and to
have a good credit, must not necessarily ever have <i>any</i> gold; but he must
be able to produce or acquire more than he consumes by his general
expenses. A country must proceed by the same process to become
wealthy, and it is simply an <i>absurdity</i> for people to talk of the <i>prosperity</i>
of the country when <i>high prices</i> for <i>everything</i> are induced and fostered
by a system which restricts <i>general</i> production in order that <i>special</i> production
may flourish. Individuals cannot get rich by trading among
themselves, <i>no matter if they increase the price</i> of their <i>wares ten per cent.
every year</i>. Neither can all the individuals of a country do the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>thing. What is required by both is increase in the quantity of what
they trade in.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not the price of what a people <i>have</i> that constitutes their true
wealth, but it is the <i>quantity</i> of their commodities. A barrel of flour is
possessed of no more real value if it cost twenty dollars instead of five.
It will not maintain life a day longer, let the price even be a thousand
dollars. Thus we arrive at the real basis of values—the real wealth—and
I have introduced this, precisely for the purpose of showing the
high-priced protectionists that they know nothing about <i>true</i> values or
<i>true</i> economy, as well as to also show that there is <i>no</i> real wealth except
that which conduces to higher ends than its simple acquisition. Wealth
as an end is despotism. Wealth as a means is humanitarianism.</p>

<p class='c007'>But to return from this departure to the main subject. For the
idea of redeemability for money there should be substituted that of
convertibility. A real money should at <i>all times</i> be capable of being
converted into <i>that</i> of which it stands <i>representative</i>. And here we arrive
at the last analysis of a real money. It will be readily seen how
completely a national currency meets this requirement. It would be
representative of the productive capacity of the country, and could always
be converted into whatever portion or kind of its products might
be required; or into the products of other countries which may be acquired
by the direct exchange of our own products.</p>

<p class='c007'>What more than this can be demanded of money; or what better
thing invented as money; or what more capable of inspiring and maintaining
an even and legitimate confidence?</p>

<p class='c007'>National currency being the very best possible money, because it is
not only the most convenient but also the most secure, there remains
<i>nothing</i> to be done but to <i>continue</i> to so <i>acquaint the people</i>, until they
become <i>convinced</i> of the rapaciousness of those systems by which
the <i>large</i> majority are compelled to labor <i>all their lives</i> for the <i>very select
few</i>. There is no difficulty in arriving at all the initial points necessary
to determine the amount required, how it should be distributed and
kept in circulation, or how its circulation should be regulated. These
are all practicalities of finance.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there is <i>one thing</i> which has never yet received consideration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>which is <i>absolutely necessary</i> to make money meet <i>all</i> the requirements
of money, and at the same time to maintain a <i>fixed</i> and <i>absolute</i> value at
all times and under all circumstances, which money never has had.
From its lacking, have come all the various financial convulsions. And
<i>this is</i>, an absolute measure of value.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can money be measured so that the same fixedness shall attach to
it that attaches to everything else with which we have to do? Money
itself has always been considered a measure of value; and it is this false
stoppage and foundationless position that has made possible all financial
discords, irregularities and inconsistencies. Does it appear to be a
strange proposition that money should be measured? Why should not
a dollar be just as absolute as a dollar as a pound is as a pound; or as
a foot is as a foot; or as a gallon is as a gallon? A cord of wood contains
one hundred and twenty-eight solid feet, or eight cord feet. It
must <i>always</i> be <i>eight</i> feet in length, <i>four</i> feet in height and <i>four</i> feet in
width, or some other multiples of one hundred and twenty-eight. A
cord can <i>never</i> be any more, <i>never</i> any less than just that measurement.
And the same rule holds of everything else with which we have to do;
with quantity, time, space and motion. All these have fixed and unvarying
modes of measurement. But money, the lever by which all
these are moved, has been left to fluctuate as it would—to be moved by
every different influence, so that in <i>many instances</i> what should have
brought contentment, peace and continuous prosperity, has bequeathed
the direct reverse.</p>

<p class='c007'>It does not concern us that there are <i>more yards of cloth</i> at one time
than another, provided that <i>yard-sticks</i> are all of the same length. But
what <i>would</i> concern us would be this: That if with increase of the
<i>quantity</i> of cloth the <i>length</i> of the yard-sticks should increase proportionately;
or with the <i>decrease</i> of the quantity of flour the <i>pound</i> should
decrease in like proportion therewith. Now this is just what has always
been true of money; its <i>real</i> value <i>increases</i> and <i>decreases</i>, just in proportion
as those things which it professes to measure have increased or
decreased in quantity. Instead of these things being exchanged or
converted into something measured by as <i>fixed</i> a <i>standard</i> as they are,
the attempt is made to measure them by <i>something</i> which <i>constantly increases</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>and <i>decreases</i> in representative capacity. In other words, a dollar
is not at all times one and the same thing. Sometimes it is but seventy–five
cents, and sometimes a dollar and a half. That to say that
seventy–five cents at one time possess the same representative power that
a dollar and a half does at another time, which is in substance to say
that money has no measure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now what is desirable and indispensable is to give money a <i>fixed
measurement</i>, which shall be <i>just</i> as absolute in its measure of the value
of money as the pound is in its measure of weight, or as the yard-stick
is in its measure of distance. There never is any more cloth, though
there be a thousand more yard-sticks. Nor is a yard-stick ever any
longer or shorter, if the quantity to be measured is increased or decreased
a thousand-fold. Now just to such a fixedness must money be
reduced before it will subserve its best purposes and uses, and the only
way this can be done is by that method which will also remove the <i>only
possible</i> objection there can be brought against such a national currency
as is proposed. This objection is that by over-issues of currency its
value would or might be depreciated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let it be supposed that the country’s extremest need to meet
the demands of the greatest amount of trade is a <i>billion dollars</i> currency.
At certain times there are greater and less demands for money,
which, under our present practices, make a dollar, to-day, worth <i>four
per cent. per annum</i> interest, and to-morrow increase it to <i>ten per cent.</i>
It must be remembered that we are now speaking of an <i>irredeemable
currency</i>, the <i>representative</i> of the <i>wealth</i> of the nation: that the <i>government</i>
representing the nation has <i>uttered</i> it, in behalf of <i>the people</i>, upon
the <i>soundest</i> and, in reality, the <i>only</i> sure basis of value <i>any</i> money <i>can
have</i>—the productive power and capacity of the nation.</p>

<p class='c007'>An over-issue is the only thing to be guarded against. The
government must be prohibited by some <i>absolute law</i> from resorting to
the process so well known in railroad management as the “<i>watering
process</i>.” And this is to be accomplished in the following manner:
This currency—this money—must be made convertible into a national
bond, bearing such a rate of interest while in the hands of the people as
shall be determined upon as “the true measure of value”—say three or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>four per cent.—which experience would necessarily determine as the
true point of balance; and the bond also convertible into currency at
the option of the holder.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other words, the people should demand that the Government
issue one thousand million dollars in bonds, bearing three per cent. interest,
payable in currency, and that it issue one thousand million dollars
of circulating medium or money to be loaned to whomsoever deposits
the bonds as collateral; all loans to be made at three per cent. per annum;
to be for six months, with two renewals of three months each,
one-half payable on each renewal. The principle underlying the time
being that all credits should be settled with each year’s products.</p>

<p class='c007'>The operation of such a system can be very easily traced. Whenever
there should be so much currency in circulation that it would be
worth <i>less</i> than four per cent., the surplus would at once be invested in
the four per cent. interest-bearing national bond; and when business
should revive and the demand for money to transact it should make
money worth <i>more</i> than four per cent., then bonds would be converted
into currency again until the equilibrium should be re-established.
And whenever the demand should be such that all the money
would be converted, and money still be worth more than four per
cent., then the government should issue enough to produce the equilibrium.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it is seen that the four per cent. or the three per cent. interest-bearing
national bond becomes the <i>fixed measure</i> of value for money. It
would always be worth <i>just that amount</i>—<i>never</i> any more; <i>never</i> any
less. The gallon measure always gives just the same quantity of molasses.
The yard-stick always gives just the same quantity of cloth.
The pound weight always gives just the same quantity of sugar. So,
too, would this measure of money always give just the same amount of
real wealth, or its representative, every day, week, month or year,
whether applied to wealth in business, to bonds, or to money at interest.
An oscillation would be perpetually maintained; first, conversion
of currency into bonds; next, conversion of bonds into currency;
and whenever the supply of currency should be deficient, <i>then the issue
of more by the government to meet it</i>. Thus there would be a <i>people’s</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>money regulated to <i>financial</i> equilibrium, which is the <i>ultima thule</i> of
convenience for exchanging the products of industry.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be remarked, parenthetically, here, that even three per cent.
per annum interest is altogether too greatly in favor of capital. A careful
calculation of interests and general increase of the nation’s wealth
discovers that less than a two per cent. interest is required to make the
capitalist and the laborer stand upon an equality. Had I the time I
would be glad to present you some figures to show to what condition
we are tending. I will simply remark, however, if capital continue to
receive the present rates of interest for the next thirty-five years, at the
end of that time it will have absorbed all the wealth of the country.
That is to say, that interest compounded at the rate of 6 per cent. upon
the present Banking Capital will amount to a sum larger than the present
aggregate of wealth together with the same rate of increase which
has governed it during the past, added thereto. Is not this a sufficiently
alarming fact to cause people to stop and consider the despotism into
which they are rapidly merging?</p>

<p class='c007'>Everybody who knows anything about the relations of money to the
people must prefer such a money as we have indicated to any other kind.
It is really the greenback system extended to <i>all uses</i> for which money is
required, and to which is given a <i>fixed measure</i> of value. All people at
present interested in national banks and high interest-paying bonds
are constitutionally opposed to such a change in our money system.
This, however, should not deter its introduction and use. The people’s
welfare is what should be consulted, and made <i>the test</i> of all propositions
that are to become theirs to practice. National banks and all banks of
issue, with their drain upon the people to make their immense profits,
must be done away, and banks simply as depositories for the accommodation
of the people, alone exist.</p>

<p class='c007'>The national bank and other currency would be gradually called
in at the rate of, say ten per cent. a month.</p>

<p class='c007'>I may add in justification of this plan, that if the Government can
loan three hundred millions to the banks for nothing, it can loan to the
people for three per cent.; if at the same time it can pay three per cent.
on its bonds and in currency, instead of six per cent. and in gold, it secures
a new-found advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>But one of the <i>chief</i> benefits which would come to the people from
the proposed currency would be the <i>interest</i> which would accrue to the
government—all the people—for the use of this money. In other
words, <i>all</i> the interest now paid to <i>banks of issue</i> for <i>loans</i>, for the
<i>same</i> convenience should be paid to the government. A <i>part</i> of the
people, for the <i>use</i> of money belonging to <i>all</i> the people, themselves inclusive,
would pay <i>interest</i> to the government therefor. And what more
legitimate method of governmental support than this, if by it all other
means of taxation could be annulled? The interest now paid by the
people of the country to the Banks and Capitalists would, twice over,
pay all costs of maintaining the government. A three per cent. interest
paid to the government on all loans the people required would not only
relieve the people who produce wealth of one-half the interest they now
pay, but also of all taxes of all kinds. Is not this a matter to be
looked into in the most serious manner?</p>

<p class='c007'>With such a currency system <i>once</i> inaugurated, the country would
begin a gradual process of general prosperity. Wealth, instead of accumulating
in a <i>few</i> hands, would continually tend to an <i>equal</i> distribution
among <i>all</i> producing people. A large part of the speculative mania
would be rendered futile, and those now devoting all their time to
<i>hatching schemes</i> by which to defraud the producing classes of their
wealth would be <i>compelled</i> to turn producers themselves. It is calculated
that one-tenth of the male population of this country is engaged
in speculative pursuits. In other words, they ‘live and grow fat’ from
those who are engaged in production. And that is our boasted equity,
our equality.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be the object of all reform to make a <i>nearer</i> approach to
a system of <i>complete</i> justice and a <i>perfect</i> equity. Any reform that does
not base itself upon <i>such</i> a proposition and whose outlook is not in this
direction <i>is no reform</i>, and does not deserve the serious attention of any.
There is scarcely an idea prevalent in the community of what true justice
and equity consist. But it may be stated as follows: <i>No person has
any just claim to the ownership of anything which he did not produce or
which he did not acquire by an equitable exchange of something which he did
produce.</i> Tested by <i>this</i> rule, the accumulated wealth of the world is in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>unjust hands; it is held by those who have a <i>no better title</i> thereto than
if they had actually stolen it. It has been fraudulently acquired, and
that is the word which best expresses the manner of its obtainment. And
one of the most effective methods of remedying this growing evil is to
attain to a true money system—one founded in the requirements to be
met and based upon that which it is to represent—that which it is to be
used to exchange. Anything that <i>departs</i> from these standards is <i>not</i>
scientific money. That which <i>has</i> these for its standards <i>is</i> a scientific
money.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aside from all that has been said, there is a general principle rising
into the comprehension of humanity which <i>must of necessity</i> dethrone
that which has so long been worshiped as the money god. The day
for arbitrary rule and standards is drawing to a close, whether they be
standards of materiality or spirituality; of morals or intellect; of despotism
or democracy. Gold <i>is</i> an arbitrary money standard, and with
all others of like character <i>must</i> fall. The tendency of the world is
<i>against it</i>, and its doom is <i>already</i> sealed. It has been <i>weighed</i> in the
balance and found wanting.</p>

<p class='c007'>The interest of the common people, who should always hear every
new Christ, demands a reform in our monetary and financial systems. We
are aware, however, that there is a great deal of prejudice in their
minds in favor of “hard money,” and they must be awakened to the
fact that hard money is a myth—a play upon words—a deception practiced
upon them by those who have played the part of “the appropriators
of wealth” lo! these many years, and who would continue to filch
<i>year</i> after <i>year</i> all that the “toiling millions” can compel nature to yield
up to them. In this process the laboring classes are the mere avenues
through which the earth pours its wealth into the coffers of the capitalists.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some object that the very numerous and intricate methods to
which resort would be required would prove <i>unmanageable</i>, and
that <i>corruption</i> would <i>inevitably</i> creep in and undermine its usefulness.
Let such consider our almost perfect postal system, and how <i>well balanced</i>
are all its movements and checks, and find therein their answer.
Would there be more intricacy in the proposed system than there now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>is in the present? Do not all national banks, though nominally
distinct, <i>really</i> have a common fountain head in government? Does
not all their currency come from government? Suppose all these
banks, instead of being independent institutions, were an organized system,
having a common head, as the banks of New York City virtually
have in the Clearing House, would not that be a condition so nearly
related to the system which would be required as to show its entire
practicability?</p>

<p class='c007'>Indeed, there is scarcely need that there should be a new department
inaugurated to bring such a currency home to the people. Perhaps
there never was a system operated in which there was <i>less</i> proportionate
loss through its executive officers than in our postal system. And this is
because the <i>responsibility</i> comes <i>home</i> to the people. The postmaster is
<i>always</i> a resident of the <i>place</i> in which he officiates, and, either with or
without a civil service law, should be the <i>appointee</i> of the citizens whom
he is to serve; and, of course, would be a person possessing their special
confidence. To such persons might the <i>care</i> of the public money
well be intrusted; and in <i>all places</i> except cities a <i>single</i> person could
perform both the services of postmaster and of United States financial
agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Means can be easily devised to make all post offices offices for loaning,
as they now sell post office stamps and money orders.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all that I have said my only purpose has been to endeavor to
arrive at a proper understanding of the most important feature of governmental
justice and uniform equity among all the people. All past
systems have failed to secure this. The world has constantly witnessed
the proceeds of the labors of the millions <i>aggregated</i> in the hands of the
few. This advantage which one class has possessed over another cannot
long exist under the rapid spread of intelligence, which marks the present
generation; and it behooves <i>this</i> people to give <i>due</i> consideration to
<i>any</i> scheme which proposes to lessen this advantage. And <i>most especially</i>
does it become the duty of the people, if there be such a thing as
<i>principles</i> of <i>finance</i>, to <i>find</i> them out and cause them to be practically
applied.</p>

<p class='c007'>In fine, and to resume, the idea of money must first be separated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>from that of the intrinsic value of gold, or any other commodity, and
confined to the mere capacity of representing all commodities, and so
of facilitating the exchanges of wealth. This, it has been abundantly
demonstrated, can be as well, and for various reasons, better done by
strips of paper, properly stamped and signed, than by gold or any other
metal.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the next place, these strips of paper, signed by the Government,
with the credit and wealth of the whole country, are better than
individual promises; though the issuance of individual promises should
not and need not be prohibited, as we do not now prohibit anybody
from making or receiving private notes, drafts and checks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, the Government Money need not be redeemable, but only
convertible into new strips of paper when the old ones are worn out, and
into commodities when they are used in trade, and into other Government
Securities bearing interest, as I have pointed out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still again, money has also been held to be a correct measure of
values. This it ought to be, indeed, but has never been so, because
it has never been measured itself. Of what use would yard-sticks be,
used for measuring cloth, but which had never themselves been
measured by anything? The system which I have stated for measuring
money itself is believed to be perfect. It is not the individual dollar,
relatively to the half dollar or the hundred dollars, that has failed to be
measured or fixed; but the rate of increase relatively to other values, of
<i>all the Government currency afloat</i>. By the convertibility of any excess
of issue sinking its value below a certain standard into interest-paying
bonds, any over-issue is immediately absorbed, while a deficiency of
issue will be revealed by the fact that absolutely no bonds will be sold.
In this manner the whole operation will be self-adjusting from day to
day; the value of the aggregate of Government money will be accurately
measured and kept uniform; and any interest or temptation
which the Government might have to an over-issue would be immediately
neutralized by the absorption of such surplus into bonds, upon
which the Government itself would be paying interest; or, in other
words, assuming an unnecessary and useless burden, in the face of the
people and of its own economies. Can anything more perfect be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>devised? If so, let us have it by all means; if not, let this device be
adopted. A self-adjusting, self-regulating admeasurement of the value
of money would make it a true measure of other values, and is a suggestion
which, if it can be secured, is of unequaled importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another somewhat similar idea was glanced at in passing—that of a
definite method of determining scientifically the equitable rate of
interest. This I cannot stop now to explain. It will, however, only
be when we come quite down to that basis, that the full value of this
financial system will be experienced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, in its basis, this system of Government money is money
issued at the mere cost of printing and circulating; but by adjoining
with it the idea of a complete, simple and exceedingly economical
means of raising the revenue of the country, the three or four per
cent. is paid to the treasury; that is to say, by the people individually
to the same people in their collective capacity. Under this system
all the various revenue officials and tax assessors and gatherers would
be dispensed with, and a vast system of economy inaugurated, which,
in a few years, would transpose us from a borrowing to a loaning nation,
making us the financial example for all the world. This it also seems
to me is another invaluable feature of the system, all of which I, however,
respectfully submit to the decision of the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>The interests of humanity which are involved in this question are
greater than are the interests of those who have assumed to <i>rule</i> the
world, and who are endeavoring to <i>fasten</i> upon the people <i>despotism</i>, to
escape from which would require the shedding of whole rivers of human
blood and the destruction of the best evidences of our civilization, for
which we have a perfect right to feel the greatest admiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>A <i>timely</i> understanding of the money question would guarantee
precisely the reverse of <i>all</i> this, and cause humanity to take still <i>greater</i>
and more rapid <i>strides</i> toward that perfect enlightenment which can
alone thoroughly recognize the common brotherhood of the human race,
toward which end all reform should be directed.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
